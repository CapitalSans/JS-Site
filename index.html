                <p class="">At Clay, user experience is not just a capability but the cornerstone of our approach. We first began as a UX design agency in San Francisco, focusing on mobile apps and enterprise/SaaS software.<br><br>
                However, our passion for branding and the demand from our clients led us to expand our offering to provide full-service brand design practice and web design and development of marketing websites.<br><br>
                Today, our projects encompass a wide range, from building new products and defining brands to revitalizing existing mobile apps, websites, and enterprise software. We specialize in crafting digital products that wholeheartedly embody the brand's personality and deliver delightful experiences to your customers.<br><br>
                Our team handles every aspect required to bring a digital product to life. This includes user research, product strategy, branding, user interface and experience design, usability testing, prototyping, web design, and development.<br><br>
                Furthermore, we boast an in-house content production studio that provides creative direction, 2D/3D design, illustration and iconography, motion design, animation, sound design, photo/video, and copywriting services.<br><br>
                For web projects, we integrate considerations for SEO into our process to ensure that our client's websites are optimized for search engines; however, SEO is not offered as a standalone service.</p>
